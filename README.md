# Zen-chatting-app

#moto --> we will try to create a chatting application for fun with different functionalites like emotion detection, showing the stastics of the users who intrested in you, privacy chatting and video calling, different levels, programming api to help with codes and so much else ...


#Technologies --->{
Front end: Reactjs or(normal html or ejs),css, sass, javascript, gsap, webgl,other technologies can be use too.

Back  end: Nodejs(javascript be runtime) , express(backend framework), socketio(for peer to peer messaging), webRTC(real time communication for video, Peerjs,opencv), other technologies also can be use .

Data base :mostly MongoDB.
}

We will break the app in 3 stages:

{First: Basic Ui(have login options, chatting space, profile page, ...) with the working of chatting BE using mongoDB.}

{Second: Amazing Ui(better colors, amazing effects, better responsiveness, real time animations , easy to understandUi )adding video calling functionality, stastics property, private chat(no DB), **record(video calls)LAST TO DO**,  }

{Third: much more to do in this .......}


//
It's a big project so it gonna take a huge time, but we will try to do as fast as we can, if we do good planning and split the work we can do it really fast.Also if you have other ideas to add more features, you can write about them here
